Introduction
============

**geomdl** is a pure Python, object-oriented B-Spline and NURBS library. It is compatible with Python versions 3.5.x and later.

Features
========

**geomdl** provides convenient data structures and highly customizable API for rational and non-rational splines along
with the efficient and extensible implementations of the following algorithms:

* B-Spline evaluation
* Derivative evaluation
* Knot insertion
* Knot removal
* Knot vector refinement
* Degree elevation
* Degree reduction
* Curve and surface fitting via interpolation and least squares approximation

**geomdl** also provides customizable visualization and animation options via Matplotlib, Plotly and VTK libraries.
Please refer to the `documentation <http://nurbs-python.readthedocs.io/>`_ for more details.
